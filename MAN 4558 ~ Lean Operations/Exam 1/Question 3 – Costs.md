# Question 3 – Costs

> Gus Lipkin

Durable Manufacturing Company wants to introduce a new product. The company estimates that the unit variable costs would be \$8, and the fixed costs would be \$70,000.

1. If the unit selling price is \$20, what is the break-even point?

   - $$
     0=(20-8)q-70000\\
     70000=12q\\
     q=5833.\bar{33}\textrm{ units}
     $$

2. If the unit selling price is set at \$18, the company expects to sell 15,000 units. What would be the total profit for this alternative?

   - $$
     (18-8)(15000)-70000\\
     (10)(15000)-70000\\
     150000-70000\\
     \textrm{profit of }\$80000
     $$

3. A foreign firm has offered to produce the product at \$10 per unit. If the unit selling price is to be set at \$20, what would be the breakeven point between the decision to “make” or “buy”?

   - $$
     (20-10)q=(20-8)q-70000\\
     10q=12q-70000\\
     70000=2q\\
     q=35000
     $$

     The decision is at breakeven point if they manufacture $35000$ units.

4. If demand is estimated to be greater than this breakeven point, what should be done, make or buy? Why?

   - If demand is greater than the breakeven point, then the company should make their own product. This is because when calculated, the profit per item is $\$10$ if the buy or $\$12$ if they make.
