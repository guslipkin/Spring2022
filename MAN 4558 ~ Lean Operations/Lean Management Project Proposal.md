## Cookie Monster

A wise blue muppet once said, ‚ÄúC is for cookie and cookie is for me!‚Äù How can we optimize the chocolate chip cookie making process so that Cookie Monster can have as many cookies as possible? We will explore and optimize the cookie making process from using decision support tools to find the nearest grocery store, to path optimization to get through the store as fast as possible, to the 5S system to organize everything when we get back home, to lean systems analysis to make sure we are getting the most out of our oven trays and racks, and finally to quality analysis to make sure that our cookies are within proper specifications. Our plan is to make the most efficient chocolate chip cookies that also taste good (I‚Äôm looking at you ‚Äúdiet‚Äù cookies üò¢).
