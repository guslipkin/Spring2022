     Big thing I see is no one day chart. There’s something for every other time period but not today. The last time it was updated was yesterday at 3pm EST. I guess because it’s a real estate company, they not as active as others. There’s also not a lot of variation in their high and low prices across the year, granted it’s still a good percentage of their current value.
