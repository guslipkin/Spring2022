3. Ratios used to compares a firm’s ratios against average ratios for other companies in the

## Chapter 15

1. In general, the more net working capital a company has **the lower its risk**.

4. The time between when the firm pays its suppliers and when it collects money from its 
   customers is known as the **cash conversion cycle**.
5. One type of investment that <u>would not be suitable</u> for marketable securities would be **mortgages**.
6. Assume net sales of \$1,200,000 and cost of goods sold of \$900,000. Determine the average 
   investment in accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable. What would be the 
   net financing need considering only these three accounts?
   1. Inventory period = Inventory/(COGS/365)  –> $55=\frac{I}{\frac{900000}{365}}$ –> $I = 135616.44$
   2. Receivables period = AR/(Sales/365) –> $35=\frac{AR}{\frac{1200000}{365}}$ –> $AR =115068.49$
   3. Payment period = AP/(COGS/365) –> $40=\frac{AP}{\frac{900000}{365}}$ –> $AP=98630.14$
   4. Net financing = AR + Inventory – AP –> $115068.49 + 135616.55-98630.14=152054.79$
7. A goal of a company’s cash management policy is to **reduce the need to borrow**.
8. 5 C’s of credit analysis
