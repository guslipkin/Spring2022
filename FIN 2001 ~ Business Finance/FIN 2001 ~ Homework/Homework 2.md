7. The following three one-year “discount” loans are available to you: 

   Loan A: \$120,000 at a 7 percent discount rate 

   Loan B: \$110,000 at a 6 percent discount rate 

   Loan C: \$130,000 at a 6.5 percent discount rate

   1. Determine the dollar amount of interest you would pay on each loan and indicate the amount of net proceeds each loan would provide. Which loan would provide you with the most upfront money when the loan takes place?

      - Loan A:
        $$
        120000*.07=8400\\
        120000-8400=111600
        $$
        Loan B:
        $$
        110000*.06=6600\\
        110000-6600=103400
        $$
        **Loan C**:
        $$
        130000*.065=8450\\
        130000-8450=121550
        $$
        Loan C has the largest upfront value.

   2. Calculate the percent interest rate or effective cost of each loan. Which one has the lowest cost?

      - Loan A: $\frac{8400}{111600}=7.53\%$
        **Loan B**: $\frac{6600}{103400}=6.38\%$
        Loan C: $\frac{8450}{121550}=6.95\%$

        Loan B has the lowest cost.
