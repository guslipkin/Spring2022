# 01 Introduction to Course

## Overview

- > This is an introductory-level course in supervised learning. Topics include **classification** and **regression**, **cross-validation** and **bootstrap**, **model selection**, **dimension reduction**, **tree-based methods**, **random forests and boosting, support-vector machines, principal components, and cluster analysis**. Students will have hands-on experience in model building, machine learning, and implementation.

- **Supervised**: Predicting or estimating an output based on one or more inputs

- **Unsupervised**: Learn relationships and structure from data with inputs but no outputs

## Focus areas

- Supervised vs unsupervised learning
- Regression vs classification
- Bias-Variance Trade off
- Prediction accuracy vs Model interopability
- Tree based methods
- Introduction to deep learning

## Example 1: Wage Data

> - Examine factors that affect wages for a group of men from the Atlantic Region of the US. We wish to understand the impact of employee’s age, education and calendar year on wage.

## Example 2: Stock Market Data

> - Examine a stock market dataset that contains the daily movements in the Standard & Poor’s 500 (S&P) stock index over a five-year period between 2001 and 2005.
  > - Goal: Predict whether the index will increase or decrease on a given day using the past 5 days’ percentage change.

## Example 3: Gene Expression Data

> - NCI60 dataset contains 6830 gene expression measurements for each of 64 cancer cell lines
  > -  Goal: Determine if there are groups, or clusters based on their gene expression measurements.
