The common brushtail possum of the Australia region is a bit cuter than its distant cousin, the American opossum. We consider 104 brushtail possums from two regions in Australia, where the possums may be considered a random sample from the population. The first region is Victoria, which is in the eastern half of Australia and traverses the southern coast. The second region consists of New South Wales and Queensland, which make up eastern and northeastern Australia.

We use logistic regression to differentiate between possums in these two regions. The outcome variable, called population, takes value 1 when a possum is from Victoria and 0 when it is from New South Wales or Queensland. We consider five predictors: sex_male (an indicator for a possum being male), head_length, skull_width, total_length, and tail_length. The logistic regression model is summarized in the following table.
